# Chat Room Application

This project is a simple chat room application implemented using Spring Boot for the backend and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Java 11 or later.
- You have a basic understanding of Spring framework concepts.
- (Optional) You have installed an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred one).

## Running the Chat Room Application

To run the Chat Room Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the Spring Boot application:
```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
or if you are using Maven directly
```mvn spring-boot:run```

Alternatively, you can run the application from your IDE by importing the project and running it directly.

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (assuming the default port is 8080, otherwise replace with the correct port number).
